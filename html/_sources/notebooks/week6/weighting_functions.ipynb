    "Recall [Stull Chapter 8](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/books/Practical_Meteorology/prmet102/Ch08-satellite_radar-v102b.pdf) Figure 8.4c (shown below).  As Stull explains a bunch of satellites use the 15 $\\mu m$ CO2 absorption band\n",
    "to look at the temperature at different heights in the atmosphere.  The key idea is that the changing density of\n",
    "the atmosphere means that at any particular wavelength there is some level where most of the emittied atmospheric\n",
    "photons originate from. If we know the vertical profile of dry air density and CO2 concentration, and the surface\n",
    "temperature, we can measure those photons and back out an estimate of the air temperature for the emitting layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The Schwartzchild equation allows us to calculate the photon flux for a particular atmosphere and surface.  This\n",
    "    is called the \"forward model\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  CO2 is the ideal absorbing gas for this calculation, because its concentration is very well known, and it\n",
    "    does not vary much with geographical location (because it takes so long to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, it\n",
    "    is \"well mixed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  In theory, if we make 15 different radiance measurements at 15 different wavelengths in the CO2 absorption band,\n",
    "    we should be able to invert the Schwartzchild equation for the temperature at 15 different heights.  In reality\n",
    "    this is not possible, because the weighting functions for each wavelength overlap with height."

    "The figure below is similar to Figure 8.4c, with the following differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The channel numbers are for an instrument called the VTPR (vertical temperature profiling radiometer), which has six channels indicated in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The horizontal axis is wavenumber = 1/wavelength.  That means that the plot goes from 500 $cm^{-1}$ (wavelength= 20 $\\mu m$) on the left to 850 $cm^{-1}$ (wavelength = 12 $\\mu m$) on the right, with the center at the center of the absorption band at wavenumber 666 $cm^{-1}$ (wavelength = 15 $\\mu m$).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The y axis is the radiance (which they call intensity) reaching the satellite, also plotted as brightness temperature on the right axis.  While the transmission at 15 $\\mu m$ (channel 1) is zero (black atmosphere) the emission is high in channel 1 because the emissivity is 1, and the stratosphere is hot.\n",
    "That is, Channel 1 is at the center of the band -- it has the lowest transmissivity and is measuring photons coming from 45 km at the top of the stratosphere (See [Stull Chapter 1, Figure 1.10](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/books/Practical_Meteorology/prmet101/Ch01-Atmos-v101.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the channel number increases from 2-6 the transmissivity also increases, and the photons originate from increasingly lower levels of the atmosphere with increasing kinetic temperatures.  Note the different heights for the peaks in each of the weighting functions."
