# UBC academic integrity

Academic honesty and integrity are essential principles of UBC and professional practice of anyone, no matter their career path. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. All future professionals have an even greater responsibility to maintain the highest level of honesty and integrity, and we should all practice those habits during our time as students. 

Cheating on exams or assignments, plagiarizing or any other form of academic dishonesty are clear violations of these principles.  During ATSC 301 quizzes and exams, the use of  the web, and communicating with anyone other than the instructors or TAs present during the quiz/exam are all strictly forbidden.  Copying and/or disseminating exam or quiz questions are also forbidden.

Inadequate contributions to work and study carried out as part of a team or group are also examples of irresponsible and unprofessional behavior. ATSC 301 labs and assignments require truthful reporting of partners / collaborations, as laid out in the course syllabus.

The “signing” statement:

As a student at UBC, I solemnly pledge to follow the policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty, including acting with integrity in all interactions with colleagues and instructors.  

By signing this pledge, I promise to maintain the highest level of ethical behavior while taking this course, including adhering to the explicit instructions above.
