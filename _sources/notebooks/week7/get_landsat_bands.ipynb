    "Landsat and Sentinel data using NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2  dataset.\n",
    "These two satellites have very similar radiometer bands, fly in similar orbits and\n",

    "have collaborated on a common dataset that gives corrected surface reflectivity and brightness\n",
    "temperatures for the two satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first few sections, we'll go over how to select a Landsat scene for a particular place and range of dates, and look at the true-color browse image.  This image is available as jpg file  without having to\n",
    "authenticate with an earthdata id.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the final section, we'll show how to download a Band 5 landsat geotiff, either on the a301hub (or for mac users) on your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use either the a301hub or your laptop to get a geotiff from Amazon, you'll need to get an [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/).  Once you've got your username and password, go to the [a301hub](https://a301hub.eoasubc.xyz/) and open a terminal.  In the terminal, run this command:\n",
