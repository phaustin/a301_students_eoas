Notes on the Marshall-Palmer distribution and the Z-RR relation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Reading:  Stull chapter 8, pages 245 - 248 on radar reflectivity
rain rate and bright band.

A brief backgrounder in where Stull gets his equation 8.30 on page 247:

.. math::

   Z = a_3 RR^{a_4}


This equation works because the collision/coalescence process for rain formation
produces a remarkably regular distribution of droplet sizes for different rainrates,
essentially "fingerprinting" the rain rate with its drop-size distribution, which
produces a unique value of the radar reflectivity.

In 1947 Marshall and Palmer published their measurements of rain drop size
as a function of rain rate:

These results are well fit by this equation:

.. math::

   n(D) = N_0 \exp(-\Lambda D)

where :math:`\Lambda=4.1 RR^{-0.21}`  with D in mm, :math:`N_D` in :math:`m^{-3}\,mm^{-1}` and RR in :math:`mm/hr`

I've put this equation into the following function in `marshall_palmer.py`_::

  def marshall_dist(Dvec,RR):
    """
       Calcuate the Marshall Palmer drop size distribution

       Input: Dvec: vector of diameters in mm
              RR: rain rate in mm/hr
       output: n(Dvec), length of Dvec, in m^{-3} mm^{-1}
    """
    N0=8000  #m^{-3} mm^{-1}
    the_lambda= 4.1*RR**(-0.21)
    output=N0*np.exp(-the_lambda*Dvec)
    return output

You can run it using its main function::

  import a301_lib
  from sat_lib.utils.marshall_palmer import main
  main()


and should see the following plot:

Here's a 2009 paper that presents the current leading contender for why
the drop-size distribution behaves this way:

* `Single-drop fragmentation determines size distribution of raindrops <https://www-nature-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/articles/nphys1340>`_

  Basically: large drops, formed by collision coallescence  are unstable bags of water that split into smaller drops with this size distribution.
