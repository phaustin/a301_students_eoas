# Week 7

## Learning goals

- Review Assignment 3b solution

- Review Friday midterm practice solutions

- Introduction to using rasterio and xarray to manage geotiff data

- Wednesday: Introduction to Landsat and Sentinel data

## At the start of class

* `conda activate a301`

* fetch and reset

          git status
          git fetch
          git reset --hard origin/main

  * If needed, update the libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
