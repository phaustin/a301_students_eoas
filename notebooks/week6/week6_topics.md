# Week 6

## Learning goals

* Introduce/review pandas

* Apply the idea of scale height to compute atmospheric profiles of density, temperature and pressure

* Use the Schwartzchild equation (Stull 8.5) to retrieve temperaure and vapor profiles with height

* Understand how radiance profiles can be used to estimate flux with the diffusivity approximation

* Work with raster images using the affine transform

## At the start of class

* `conda activate a301`

* fetch and reset

          git status
          git fetch
          git reset --hard origin/main
          

* Check to see whether your library version is up to date by comparing [the latest tag](https://github.com/phaustin/a301_students_eoas/tags) with the output of `hdf4_inspect --version`

  * If needed, update the libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
