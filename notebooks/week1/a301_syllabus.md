## Course objectives

By the end of this course you should have a good understanding of

1. how radiation is emitted, absorbed, transmitted and reflected by
   surfaces, clouds, and the atmosphere  (the "forward problem")
2. how radiometers, radars and lidars are used to infer
   temperature and surface and cloud properties (the "inverse problem")
3. how orbiting radar and climate sensors (MODIS, Cloudsat, Calypso, GOES ABI) are combined with
   global forecast models to study the atmosphere, ocean and land surface
3. how to map spatial remote sensing data the earth's surface using Python's geographic information software  
4. how to write clear, documented and tested code that can ingest, manipulate and display
   data, and how to turn equations into computer algorithms in Python
