# Week 8

## Learning goals

- Review midterm solution

- Learn how to subset regions of Landsat images

- Use pandas to sort and to analysis on a large number of landsat scenes

- Use the normalized vegetation difference index to track changes in vegetation from 2013-2022

## At the start of class

* `conda activate a301`

* fetch and reset

          git status
          git fetch
          git reset --hard origin/main
          

* Check to see whether your library version is up to date by comparing [the latest tag](https://github.com/phaustin/a301_students_eoas/tags) with the output of `hdf4_inspect --version`

  * If needed, update the libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Week 8 topics for Monday

### Assignment 4

For assignment 4, you'll construct a timeseries of Landsat normalized vegetation index (NDVÎ™) for
spring, summer, fall, and winter between 2013 and 2022. 

1) Read the metadata for all images into a pandas dataframe
2) Use pandas to select 1 scene for each season with minimum cloud cover
3) Select a 200 pixel x 300 pixel subregion of the scene to study
4) Write functions to fetch and store the clipped region for each scene
5) Calculate and plotting the NDVI time series
