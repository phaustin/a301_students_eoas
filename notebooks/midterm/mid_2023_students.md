# A301 midterm -- March, 2023

Q1) (12) A satellite orbiting at an altitude of 36000 km observes the
    surface in the $CO_2$ absorption band with a wavelength
    range of 14 μm  $< λ < 16$ μm.

-   Q1a) (4 points) The atmosphere is 20 km thick, and has a density scale height of
    $H_\rho$ = 9 km and a surface air density of
    $\rho_{air}$ = 1.1 $kg\,m^{-3}$. The $CO_2$ mass
    absorption coefficient is
    $k_λ$ = 0.15 $m^2\,kg^{-1}$ at
    λ = 15 μm and its mixing ratio is $4 \times 10^{−4}\,kg\,kg^{-1}$.
    Find the:

    - the atmosphere’s vertical optical thickness
        $τ_λ$ in the $CO_2$ band

    - the atmosphere’s transmittance $t_\lambda$ in the $CO_2$
        band

    for a pixel directly beneath the satellite.
    
    
    - Q1a answer
    
        - The definition for optical depth:
        
            $$

-  Q1b) (4 points) If the surface is a blackbody with a temperature of 290 K, and
        the atmosphere has a constant temperature of 270 K, find the

    -   monochromatic radiance observed by the satellite at 15
        μm in ($W\,m^{-2}\,\mu m^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$)

    -   the brightness temperature of the pixel in Kelvins for that
        radiance

-  Q1c) (4 points) Given a pixel size $10\ km^2$, find:

    -   the imager field of view in steradians

    -   the flux, in $W\,m^{-2}$ at the satellite for the wavelength range between
        14-16 $\mu m$
        
Q2) (6 points) For the same atmosphere as in Q1) (i.e. scale height of 9 km and isothermal temperature of 270 K) find the radiance between 14-16 $\mu m$ reaching the satellite that originates from the atmospheric layer between heights $z=1\ km$ and $z=6\ km$ in $W\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}$


Q3) (3 points) A cone has a spreading angle of 35 degrees between its center
    and its side. What is its subtended solid angle?
