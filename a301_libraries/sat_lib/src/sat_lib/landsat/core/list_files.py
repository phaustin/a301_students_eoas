    Simple file listing function with more versatility than python builtins or arcpy.List

    This function sifts through a directory and returns a list of filepaths for all files
    meeting the input criteria. Useful for discriminatory iteration or recursive searches.
    Could be used to find all tiles with a given datestring such as 'MOD11A1.A2012', or
    perhaps all Band 4 tiles from a directory containing landsat 8 data.

    :param recursive:       'True' if search should search subfolders within the directory
                            'False' if search should ignore files in subfolders.
    :param directory:       The directory in which to search for files meeting the criteria
    :param contains:        search criteria to limit returned file list. File names must
                            contain parameters listed here. If no criteria exists use 'False'
    :param not_contains:    search criteria to limit returned file list. File names must not
                            contain parameters listed here. If no criteria exists use 'False'

    :return filelist:        An array of full filepaths meeting the criteria.
