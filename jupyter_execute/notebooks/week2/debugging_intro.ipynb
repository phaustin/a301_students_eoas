    "2. Use descriptive variable names. Avoid naming variables things like `a` or `foo`, as you will easily forget what they were used for.\n",
    "   1. An exception to this rule is when using temporary variables (e.g., counts), which can be as short as a single character.\n",
    "3. Try to write your code in a consistent style to ensure that it is predictable across problem sets. You'll thank yourself for this later!\n",

Why might this be? Tracing the `axis` object back to its definition on line 3, we  see that the `subplots` method is the culprit. Looking up [`subplots`](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots) in the matplotlib documentation, we see that this method returns as many axis objects as there are cells in a subplot grid. In our case, since we specified a grid of size $2 \\times 1$, it returned two separate axis objects inside a single array. When we asked Python to access the `plot` method of our array on line 7, it understandably got confused -- arrays don't have a `plot` method! With this in mind, we can adjust our code to resolve the issue. One solution would be ignore the second subplot entirely:"
